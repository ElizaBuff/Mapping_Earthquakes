# Mapping Earthwaukes

## Overview of Project
### Purpose of Project
In this project, I demonstrated my proficiency with various JavaScript, Leaflet.js, and geoJSON features including: adding multiple maps and a base layer, mapping GeoJSON LineStrings and Points, adding data to a Leaflet map, styling data on a Leaflet map, adding data as overlay, adding data to a LayerGroup class. 

### Background of Project
Disater Reporting network, a fictional nonprofit company, provides data driven storytelling on disasters around the world. As the Data Visualization Specialist, I built insightful data visualization with interactive features on earthquakes from around the world. My role was to support website and mobile application development by using the latest GeoJSON data from the U.S. Geological Survey website, traverse and retrieve the earthquake data using JavaScript and the D3 and leaflet libraries and plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request. The map includes the magnitude and location of the earthquake shown dynamically through a popup marker. The diameter of the marker for each earthquake reflects the magnitude of the earthquake in size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes are larger and darker with a legend providing context for the map. Additionally, to illustrate the relationship between the location and frequency of seismic activity and tectonic plates, fault lines have been added to the map.

## The Map 
The “Filter Search” allows users to search for UFO sightings by date, city, state, country, or shape. The search can be done using any combination of filters. For example, a user could search by just the state of Oregon, just triangle shaped UFOs, or by a combination of the state of Oregon and triangle shaped UFOs.  

### FORMATING 
* Date is entered as MO/DA/YEAR
* State and Country are entered using their two letter abbreviations 

### HOW TO SEARCH 
ADD FILTER 
* Choose any filter  
* Type your criteria 
* Hit Enter [table will adjust] 
* OPTIONAL: repeat for remaining filters


REMOVE FILTER 
* Choose filter you want to remove
* Delete text
* Hit Enter [table will adjust]


### EXAMPLE
**Example 1: You want to search for sightings in the state of Oregon**
ADD FILTER 
* Choose any filter = "I want to search by the *state* of Oregon."  
* Type your criteria = The abbreviation for Oregon, "or", is typed under "Enter a State". 
* Hit Enter = The table will look like the image below.
